# Frontend Technical Interview

This interview tests the candidates ability to ingest product requirements and implement them using React, React Custom Hooks, Typescript, and Redux. The candidate is able to use google and collaborate with ID Plans team members. Hints will also be given when necessary.

## Requirements
- Fetch product list based on selected category (category fetch and selection already implemented) within a custom react hook. Use proper promise and error handling. Endpoint: GET - https://dummyjson.com/products/category/{category}
- Persist product list to redux state. This will require creating reducers, selectors, and necessary types.
- Display product list below categories. For each product, display thumbnail, title, description, and price.
